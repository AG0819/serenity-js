<div class="known-issue">
:disappointed: **CAUTION**: As of [Protractor 5.1.0](https://github.com/angular/protractor/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#510),
[Webdriver-manager](https://github.com/angular/webdriver-manager) will always grab the latest versions of all binaries 
(Selenium standalone, chromedriver, iedriver, gecko driver), which ensures that they're compatible with newly released 
web browsers. However, Selenium standalone 3.0.1 has a bug which prevents it from working with any version of Firefox. 

:smirk: **WORKAROUND**: To test with Firefox 51 use Selenium 3.0.0-beta4. You can instruct the `webdriver-manager`
to download this version by adding `--versions.standalone=3.0.0-beta4`

:relieved: **FIX**: The issue _should be_ fixed in Selenium 3.0.2.
